# Wholesale Accounts 1 - Payment Terms

[https://docs.centra.com/soap/index.php?op=paymentterms_Update](https://docs.centra.com/soap/index.php?op=paymentterms_Update)

Create or update payment terms. The payment terms are set on an account, so they should be created before the account data is sent to Centra.

Notice that `<name>` is the name or title of the payment term in the Centra admin. The `<description>` is a longer optional descriptive text. This is different form other data in the API where `<description>` is the name or title of something.
